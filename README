Installation:

  1. Get processing from www.processing.org.
  
  2. From within the processing IDE menu, click Sketch > Import Library ... > Add library. Then install the Midibus library.
  
  3. Place your pictures in a folder named "data" inside the sketch folder (ie "sketch_180427a/data/photo.jpg"). You can also change the dataDir path at the top of the sketch to fetch photos from elsewhere. The path is relative to the sketch folder.

Note: you might want to reduce the resolution of your images to help perfomance. Google "batch resizing" and you should find what you need. Also make sure you use one of the allowed file extensions.
