Installation:

  1. Get processing from www.processing.org.
  
  2. From within the processing IDE menu, click Sketch > Import Library ... > Add library. Then install the Midibus library.

  3. Make a selection of up to 128 images with one of the following formats: ".jpg", ".png" or ".pdf".

  4. Batch resize the images to your screen resolution (printed to console on startup) to preserve image proportions. To preserve "phasing" of image cycling (e.g. switching full image into view every x taps), resize with padding. You can use https://bulkresizephotos.com/ with "Exact Size" and "Pro" mode settings for this task.
  
  5. Place your pictures in a folder named "data" inside the sketch folder (ie "sketch_180427a/data/photo.jpg"). You can also change the dataDir path at the top of the sketch to fetch photos from elsewhere. The path is relative to the sketch folder.
