Installation:

  1. Get processing from www.processing.org.
  
  2. From within the processing IDE menu, click Sketch > Import Library ... > Add library. Then install the Midibus library.
  
  3. Place your pictures in a folder named data inside the sketch folder (ie "sketch_180427a/data/photo.jpg"). You can also change the dataDir path at the top of the sketch to fetch photos from elsewhere. The path is relative to the sketch folder.
