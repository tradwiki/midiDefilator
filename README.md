Installation:
======
1. Get processing from www.processing.org.

2. From within the processing IDE menu, click Sketch > Import Library ... > Add library. Then install the Midibus library.

3. Make a selection of up to 128 images with one of the following formats: ".jpg", ".png" or ".pdf".

4. Batch resize the images to a resolution proportional to your screen resolution (printed to console on startup). You can use https://bulkresizephotos.com/ with "Exact Size" for this task. Reducing the resolution while keeping proportions can help with performance.

5. Place your pictures in a folder named "data" inside the sketch folder (ie "sketch_180427a/data/photo.jpg"). You can also change the dataDir path at the top of the sketch to fetch photos from elsewhere. The path is relative to the sketch folder.
